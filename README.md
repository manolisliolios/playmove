# Playmove

A basic Sui Move Playground for trying out code in the browser. 

## Structure

The project consists of two parts:

1. A [web service](./crates/api/) that builds/tests the move code
2. The [web components](/web/)

There's a react component that can be used to render playgrounds in your website. 
This is mainly useful for documentation pages!
